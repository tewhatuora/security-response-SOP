### Guideline objective
To guide Duty Nurse Managers (DNM) and Security staff in managing the trespass of a person or persons causing concern or who pose a risk to Capital & Coast, Hutt Valley & Wairarapa Health New Zealand Te Whatu Ora or any person. This relates to the issue and enforcement of the Trespass Act 1980. 

### Scope
For the purposes of this document, staff will refer to:
All staff within Health New Zealand | Te Whatu Ora Capital, Coast, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa. 
This includes staff not working in direct contact with patients/consumers.  Staff are taken to include anyone engaged in working to the Capital Coast, Hutt Valley & Wairarapa Districts. This may include but is not limited to:
- Employees irrespective of their length of service
- Agency workers
- Self-employed workers
- Volunteers
- Consultants
- Third party service providers, and any other individual or suppliers working for [organisation], including personnel affiliated with third parties, contractors, temporary workers and volunteers
- Students

### Purpose
In very exceptional circumstance it may be necessary to trespass a person from the property.
The specifically worded Health NZ Te Whatu Ora Trespass notice must be used, explained to the person and acknowledged. This allows for that person to be aware they can still access emergency medical treatment and appointments during the Trespass period.

Therefore, trespass may only be considered appropriate due to one or more of the following:
- causing disruption to clinical services that impacts directly on service delivery or patient wellbeing
- serious harm caused by; abusive, threatening, ongoing harassment, intimidating or showing / offering violence to others
- Repeated unauthorised access or out of hours presence, in a secure area (i.e. for purposes of carrying out criminal activity).
- Formally trespassed from the site and returns without legal justification. 

### Authority to trespass

Only the Group Director Operations or Principle Legal Counsel-District   can authorise a person to be trespassed from Health NZ Te Whatu Ora property. Authority for this can also be designated to another in their absence or for after-hours purposes. Uusually this would be the Security Manager or Duty Nurse Manager.  This should be by written notice of authority. In all cases the reason for trespass authorisation must be clearly detailed in a report from the Security Manager of the Hospital involved and have a recommendation from the relevant areas Group Manager. This is forwarded for approval to the Principle Legal Counsel-District for final consideration. If approved, the Principle Legal Counsel-District officially authorises the trespass notice. Any decision to issue a trespass order will be on the basis that it will significantly reduce the risk of serious harm to others and/or will prevent major disruption to Health NZ Te Whatu Ora services. 

### Guideline measurement
Any incidents must be recorded as a Reportable event/s. Breaches of the guideline are reported, monitored and investigated as per the incident management policy.

### Legally serving a trespass notice
There is no legal requirement to give a trespass notice in writing. However, a written document should be used where possible as it reinforces the situation for the person given the trespass notice; they cannot say they did not know of the notice and requirement to leave the property. This also allows for the special terms to be communicated clearly.
A copy of the Health NZ Te Whatu Ora Trespass Notice is at Appendix A.
Once served the person who serves the notice must complete a service notice.
A copy of the “Details of Service notice” is at Appendix B.

### Verbal trespass
A verbal trespass can be issued in emergency situations, however, approval is still required and confirmation should be obtained by email prior to action.
To deliver a trespass notice verbally, it is advisable to record the date and time along with the reason for giving a trespass notice to the person. Also record the name or description of the person and any other information that may be relevant. 
This should be completed on the ‘Details of Service of Trespass Notice’ at Appendix B.

### Written trespass
As mentioned a written trespass is preferable. Complete 4 copies of the Trespass Notice (Appendix A):
- one copy to the person you are serving the trespass notice on
- one copy for the Security Manager
- one copy to give to the nearest police station or attending police officer, for entering into the Police records database.
- one copy to be sent to Legal Services.

### How to serve a trespass notice
If the person is very aggressive or very abusive call Police immediately on 1-111. 
Security staff are responsible for physically serving the document unless it would not be safe to do so, then Police may serve the notice on behalf of. 
To serve a notice you simply hand it to the person and explain the conditions so it is clear they can return to seek emergency treatment or for an appointment. If they refuse to accept it and it drops on the ground, it is still considered to be served. Keep that copy and note down that the person refused to accept the notice.
You are required to give a reasonable time for the trespasser to leave. If the person stays or takes an unreasonable time to comply, call 1-111 and ask for Police. If compliant security staff should escort them from the property. At no time should force be used.
If someone comes back after you have given them a trespass notice they will have committed an offence. Call 1-111 and ask for Police, Security should be advised immediately.

### Trespass conditions

The hospital is a public place and members of the public must be allowed to be in the hospital for treatment and appointments. This can seem counter to any trespass notice that has been served. However, ensuring people can access emergency treatment when required is paramount. It is therefore legally acceptable to place conditions onto a trespass notice. These conditions may detail the circumstance that the individual may legally come to the property. In the hospital this could be, but not limited to attend when:
- in an emergency medical visit
- visiting other parts of the hospital for official appointments
- supervised / managed visits
- to conduct necessary business that cannot be conducted remotely  

Trespass Notices are effective for up to 2 years from the date stipulated on the Trespass Notice. To revoke a Trespass Notice after issue, then a letter must be written to the person served detailing that the Trespass Notice has been revoked and the person is free to resume access to the site. 

### Actions to take
It is important to ensure that all steps are taken to firstly use calming, de-escalation and reasoning techniques to modify a person’s behaviour. Staff will need to be patient and show empathy to the person at all times. At the earliest opportunity call for assistance from Security as it is a priority is to keep yourself, staff and patients safe. If the person does not modify their behaviour:
- Consult the security management team to establish a Safety Plan.
- Consider Trespass - Only in exceptional circumstances and as a last resort
- Determine if trespass address is singular or covers more than one location - seek Legal advice. 
- Detail all reasons for trespass in a written report which should be sent to the relevant areas Group manager and the Security manager.
- Report and recommendations are then sent to the Principle Legal Counsel-District for consideration and approval.
- Obtain permission for authority to trespass.
- Complete the trespass notice (Appendix A) with authorising signature.
- If the incident relates to / affects other departments, notify the appropriate department of the known details.
- All details of actions taken are recorded in full. 
- Ensure a Reportable event is completed and / or reviewed.
- Copy of trespass order to relevant people.
  - If they are compliant escort to the boundary only
  - If they do not leave then disengage and seek Police assistance
  - If possible obtain the person(s) name and address.
  - Record details of any Police incident number.
  - Complete Security incident report or SQUARE for all incidents.
  - Security Manager can provide further advice and access to CCTV coverage of incidents pursuant to the CCTV Policy
